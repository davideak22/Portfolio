The 32nd Scientific Student Conference (Tudományos Diákköri Konferencia), organized by the Marosvásárhelyi Magyar Diákszövetség (MMDSZ), took place from May 7 to 10, 2025 in Marosvásárhely. Held at the historic Cultural Palace with its opening at the National Theatre and presentations at the Kultúrpalota, this event brought together around 230 scientific papers across 19 different sections covering medical, pharmaceutical, and dental sciences.

The main goal of the conference is to help university students who speak Hungarian by providing a forum for them to present their research in their native language. In addition to student involvement, a number of highly regarded guest lecturers gave presentations, such as orthopedic researcher Dr. István Gergely from the Indiana University School of Medicine.
