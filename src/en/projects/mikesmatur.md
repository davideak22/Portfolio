The Maturándusz(Matúr) is a popular event in Mikes Kelemen High School organized each year by 11th-grade students for the graduating class. It is a celebration aimed to provide the 12th grade with one final enjoyable experience together before they separate ways, allowing them to reinforce relationships formed over years of sharing the same class from 9th to 12th grade.

The event is divided into three parts: camp, week, and gala.  The camp brings all three classes together for enjoyable and interesting games, transforming the days into friendly competition.  The Matúr week takes place at school, when adolescents play during breaks and dress up according to daily themes, adding color and energy to the hallways.  It all finishes in the gala, where each class performs on stage in a theatre-style performance.  The evening ends with a tearful farewell from the 11th grade to the graduates, followed by an after-party where the celebrations continue.
